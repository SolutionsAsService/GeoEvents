  "description": "The Younger Dryas was a return to glacial conditions which temporarily reversed the gradual climatic warming after the Last Glacial Maximum. It was the last stage of the Pleistocene epoch and preceded the current, warmer Holocene epoch. It was the most severe and longest-lasting of several interruptions to the warming of the Earth's climate.",
